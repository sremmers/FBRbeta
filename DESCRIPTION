Description: The Finite BOLD Response (FBR) is an analysis method for fMRI 
    for fMRI data. This method convolves the HRF with a design matrix. 
    This design matrix includes several boxcars with a particular length. The 
    FBR is a superior method in event-related designs and in models with lag 
    between HRF onset and stimulus onset. The advantange of the FBR is that it
    is a flexible method, and it can estimate the BOLD. This current
    implication of the FBR is based on beta-series. Each BOLD will get several
    beta-values, depending on the amount and the length of the boxcars.
    The \code{\link{fbrbetafunc}} is the general functions for the FBR.
    This code consists of several other functions:
      A function to shuffle the first timing, \code{\link{timingmatrix}}
      A function to obtain the beta's from X and y, \code{\link{betafunc}},
      A code to make boxcars of a particular timing  \code{\link{boxcars}},
      A code that combines \code{\link{timingmatrix}} and \code{\link{boxcars}}
      in a function called \code{\link{designmatrix}}. 
    See the vignette for a nice example and explanation.
