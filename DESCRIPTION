Description: The Finite BOLD Response (FBR) is a method to analyze fMRI 
    Data. This method convolves the HRF with a design matrix. 
    This design matrix includes several boxcars with a particular length. The 
    FBR is a superior method for fast event-related designs and in models with lag 
    between HRF onset and stimulus onset. The advantange of the FBR is that it
    is a flexible method, and it can estimate the BOLD. This current
    implication of the FBR is based on beta-series. Each BOLD will get several
    beta-values, depending on the amount and the length of the boxcars.
    See the vignette for a nice example and explanation.
